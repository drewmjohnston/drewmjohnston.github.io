abstract: "We analyze de-identified data from Facebook to show how social connections affect beliefs and behaviors in high-stakes settings. During the Covid-19 pandemic, individuals with friends in regions facing severe disease outbreaks reduced their mobility substantially more than their demographically similar neighbors with friends in less affected areas. To explore the mechanisms through which social connections shape behaviors, we show that individuals with higher friend exposure to Covid-19 are more inclined to publicly support social distancing measures and less likely to join groups advocating for reopening the economy. These findings suggest that friends influence individualsâ€™ behaviors in part through their beliefs, even in the presence of abundant information from expert sources."
