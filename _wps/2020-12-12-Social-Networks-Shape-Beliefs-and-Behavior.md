abstract: "We analyze de-identified data from Facebook to show how social connections affect beliefs and behaviors in high-stakes settings. During the Covid-19 pandemic, individuals with friends in regions facing severe disease outbreaks reduced their mobility more than their demographically similar neighbors with friends in less affected areas. To explore why social connections shape behaviors, we show that individuals with higher friend exposure to Covid-19 are more supportive of social distancing measures and less likely to advocate to reopen the economy. We conclude that friends influence individualsâ€™ behaviors in part through their beliefs, even when there is abundant information from expert sources."
