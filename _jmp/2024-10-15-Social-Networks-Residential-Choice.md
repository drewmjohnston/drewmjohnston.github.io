abstract: "Why don't more Americans move to places with better economic prospects? We find that social networks play a crucial role in explaining this puzzle: social networks tend to be concentrated locally and shape oneâ€™s decision where to live. Using individual-level data from Facebook, we show that on average, 70\% of a one's friends live within 100 miles, with low-skilled individuals having even more concentrated social networks. To establish a causal link between the location of an individual's social network and their residential choice, we use a quasi-experimental approach exploiting exogenous variation in the timing of friends' moves around college graduation. Having one more friend in a given commuting zone increases one's likelihood of living there by 0.3 percentage points, comparable in magnitude to the effect of a several hundred dollar increase in annual wages. Incorporating these findings regarding the distributions and effects of social networks into a spatial equilibrium model explains why so many people remain in areas with substantially fewer economic opportunities, and why low-skilled people are much less responsive to economic shocks."
