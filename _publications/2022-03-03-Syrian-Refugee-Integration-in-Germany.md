abstract: "We use Facebook data to study Syrian migrants' social integration in Germany, establishing five findings: (1) Migrants' social integration varies across regions, driven by causal, place-based effects. (2) This spatial variation reflects both how frequently Germans befriend neighbors and how likely they are to befriend migrants versus other Germans. Using a mover's design, we show that both factors are shaped more by local institutions and policies than by persistent native characteristics. (3) Integration courses boost inter-group friending rates. (4) Migrants receive help from Germans, such as finding jobs or housing. (5) Germans quasi-randomly exposed to migrants in high school are likelier to befriend migrants later."
